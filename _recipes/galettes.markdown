steps:
- description: Grab a mixing bowl and add in the buckwheat flour, whisk in one of
    the eggs and then gradually add the water to form the mixture for the galette.
- description: Add a teaspoon of coconut oil to a frying pan on a high heat and then
    add a scoop of the mixture to the pan to cook until the galette is firm. While
    it's cooking, you can slice the spring onions and break up the ham.
- description: Then crack another one of the eggs on it and use the back of a fork
    to spread the egg white around the surface. Once you're happy, make sure the yolk
    rests in the middle, then put a lid on to steam the egg white until it's firm
    (and the yolk is still runny).
- description: Now break up the ham and scatter it over the galette, avoiding the
    egg yolk. Then grab the grater and grate the cheese over the ham and then sprinkle
    the sliced spring onion on it.
- description: Now season the galette with the nutmeg and pepper, avoiding the egg
    yolk again, then sprinkle a little salt on the egg yolk.
- description: Use a spatula to fold over the edges of the galette to form a square,
    leaving the yolk exposed in the middle, then serve and start the next one!
- description: If you don't want to cook all four in one go, the mixture will keep
    in the fridge for a few days.
