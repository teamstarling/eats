steps:
- description: Preheat the oven to 200C.
- description: Add a tbsp of olive oil to 6 holes in the muffin tray and put it in
    the oven to heat for at least 10 minutes.
- description: Grab a mixing bowl and add in the cornflour and beat in the eggs with
    a whisk.
- description: Once thoroughly combined, gradually add the oat milk to form the mixture
    for the yorkshires.
- description: Once the oil is hot enough, pour the mixture evenly into the 6 holes
    (it's helpful to use a jug for this) and then return the tray back to the oven.
    It's important to be quick at this step to prevent the oil from cooling too much.
- description: Bake for 20 minutes until they're golden. You'll need to keep the door
    shut for the entire cooking time, otherwise they won't rise properly.
